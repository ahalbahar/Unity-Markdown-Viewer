## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-11

### Initial Release

This is a **complete rewrite** of the original [UnityMarkdownViewer](https://github.com/gwaredd/UnityMarkdownViewer) project with nearly 100% new code, built from the ground up with modern features and professional rendering.

### Added

#### Core Features
- **Full Markdown Support** – Complete support for Headers (H1–H6), emphasis (bold, italic, strikethrough), lists, code blocks, blockquotes, tables, and more
- **10+ Professional Theme Presets** – VS Code Dark+, GitHub Light, GitHub Dark, Dracula Dark, Nord Dark, OneDark Dark, Monokai Dark, Solarized Dark, Solarized Light, and Catppuccin Mocha Dark
- **Interactive Anchor Navigation** – Click heading anchor links (e.g., `[jump](#section-id)`) to scroll directly to sections with smooth navigation
- **Image Rendering** – Inline image support with automatic caching and web URL support
- **GitHub-style Admonitions** – Full support for `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!WARNING]`, `> [!IMPORTANT]`, `> [!CAUTION]` with custom styling
- **Custom Heading IDs** – Define custom anchor IDs with `{#custom-id}` syntax or auto-generated IDs from heading text

#### Syntax Highlighting
- **Multi-language support** – C#, JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, Rust, CSS, HTML, YAML, and more
- **Smart color coding** – Keywords, types, strings, comments, numbers, methods, all properly highlighted
- **Theme-aware** – All syntax colors adapt dynamically to the selected theme preset

#### Editor Features
- **Live theme preview** – Side-by-side light/dark skin comparison in the theme editor
- **One-click preset application** – Instantly switch between 10 beautiful themes with preset buttons
- **Project Settings theme access** – Configure the active theme from `Project/AB/Markdown Viewer` in addition to editing the theme asset directly
- **Unity Package Manager support** – Git-based installation through package name `com.ab.unitymarkdownviewer`
- **Cross-version emoji rendering** – Unity 6 uses native text emoji rendering, while Unity versions older than Unity 6 render emoji through a configurable CDN source chain with a clearer theme-editor configuration UI
- **Raw text mode** – Toggle between formatted markdown and raw text view for debugging
- **Navigation history** – Back/forward buttons to browse previously opened markdown files
- **Responsive layout** – Automatically adapts to Inspector width changes
- **Dark mode support** – Seamless integration with Unity 6 Editor UI and light/dark themes

#### Advanced Capabilities
- **HTML entity handling** – Proper rendering of `<`, `>`, `&` and other special characters
- **Smart text wrapping** – Intelligent line breaking for long content and code blocks
- **Code block syntax** – Specify language for proper syntax highlighting (e.g., ` ```csharp `)
- **Table rendering** – Full support for GitHub-style Markdown tables with alignment
- **Escape sequences** – Raw text mode toggles between markdown and plaintext view

- **Performance optimized** – Lazy layout with caching and efficient texture pooling

### Documentation

- **README.md** – Complete feature overview, installation, usage, and customization guide
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** – Guidelines for reporting issues and submitting pull requests
- **CHANGELOG.md** – This file, documenting all changes and releases

### Packaging

- **Release workflow** – GitHub Actions stages the repository into `Assets/AB/Unity-Markdown-Viewer` and uses `natsuneko-laboratory/create-unitypackage@v3` to build the `.unitypackage`
- **Manual package rebuilds** – The same workflow supports `workflow_dispatch`, so package artifacts can be regenerated without pushing a new tag
- **Curated package contents** – The release package excludes repository-only folders such as `.github`, `tools`, `PackageBuilds`, `CODE_QUALITY_FINDINGS.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **Package Manager theme fallback** – Default theme asset creation supports Package Manager installs by creating the writable theme asset under `Assets/AB/Unity-Markdown-Viewer/Theme` when the package itself lives under `Packages/`
